Macros and data can be uploaded here to share them among the group members, to track changes, and to get all the file modifications in real-time directly on VS Code

```
git clone https://github.com/NicolaSommaggio/AdvanceLab-g-2.git
```
The repository is structured in this way for the moment:
g-2 contains everything : 
* **src : contains only source files (i.e. Root Macros)
* **Data : contains the root files, sometimes organized in folders
